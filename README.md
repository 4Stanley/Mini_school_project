# Mini_school_project
In this project, you will write three programs to collect information required for the school report cards of five students. Each student does the same three subjects whose names are stored in an array as follows:
 • Names of the three subjects (an array; the subjects are MAT, PHY, CSC) The following details are collected for each student: 
• Name (a character array)
 • ID (an integer) 
• Scores on 100 for the three subjects (an integer array) 
• The letter grades of the three subjects (an array; the possible grades are A, B, C, D, E, F). For each subject, you will calculate the letter grade using the following table:

• The first program should read its data from the keyboard into an array (10 marks) 
• The second program should read its data from the keyboard into a linked list (10 marks) 
• The third program should read its data from a text file into a linked list (10 marks). The text file should have the data arranged as follows: Student ID, Scores for MAT, PHY, and CSC, Student name (i.e., four numbers followed by a string of characters). Each student’s data is provided on a separate line.
 An example text file for three students is given below:
 250 75 68 82 John Jones 
1243 42 55 39 Suzy Paula Doe 
324 55 43 80 Doe .
For each program, your output should comprise the following three tables.
